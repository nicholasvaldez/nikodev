## An Introduction 

Hey. 'Sup.

Welcome to **NeekoDev.**

First and foremost, this is not a 'blog' per say. 
Think of it as a glorified notebook of things that I'm currently learning in my current role as Software Developer. I use the term 'blog' lightly here as these are in-fact article writings, but for an audience of one - myself. 

I fully intend to use this site to reinforce my learning and track my *~journey~* ✨  as a Dev. I figure that it also gives me an excuse to dive deeper into research and fully explore the topics that I choose to write about. So who am I?
## Neeko

No, I don't main Neeko in League of Legends. my name is Nicholas or Nick or Nico and my wife's name is Neeka and.. well?  Get it? My main in LOL was Wukong anyways.

Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, (me?) I'm not a prominent thought leader in this world. I'm just a guy who's 8 weeks into to his first job as a Developer hoping to grow in this career field. Which brings me to my next point: the **other** reason why I wanted to start this ~~blog~~ *website(?).* 

I noticed that the blogs I frequent , granted I don't do this often, or see being reviewed on YouTube, discuss topics that are either very simplified or advanced/ requires years of experience to even understand what they are talking about.  There's a blind spot of Devs going through it in real time discussing their experiences and what they're learning **in order** of what they're learning.

So, okay, secrets out, maybe I *am* writing as if somebody reads these writings other than me someday. If you do, I hope I can shed some light on what an experience-challenged dev may be learning at work, or even in life honestly, if you're into that.

## Closing Thoughts

As I wrap up this inaugural post on NeekoDev, I can't help but feel a mix of excitement and curiosity about the journey ahead. This space is not just a collection of articles; it's a living documentation of my growth, stumbles, and victories in the vast world of software development.

To whoever might stumble upon these digital pages, whether it's a fellow developer navigating their own challenges or a future version of myself reflecting on the early days—I welcome you.

As I pen down my thoughts and discoveries, I'm reminded that every line of code written, every bug fixed, and every "aha" moment is a step forward. So here's to the lines of code yet to be written, the bugs waiting to be discovered, and the countless "aha" moments that lie ahead.

Until next time.
